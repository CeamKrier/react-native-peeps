React-native implementation of the hand drawn illustration library called [Open Peeps](https://www.openpeeps.com/)

<p align="center"><img src="example.png" alt="peeps example" width="200"/></p>

## Installation

```
npm install react-native-peeps
```

Module depends on react-native-svg, so install it too.

```
npm install react-native-svg
```

If your React Native version is below 0.60 the auto-linking feature won't work. You need to follow the steps to complete your installation of the [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#manually).
Otherwise, running the `npm install react-native-svg` command will be sufficient.


## Usage

<div data-snack-id="@ceamkrier/9ba06b" data-snack-platform="web" data-snack-preview="true" data-snack-theme="light" style="overflow:hidden;background:#fafafa;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.08);border-radius:4px;height:505px;width:100%"></div>
<script async src="https://snack.expo.io/embed.js"></script>
